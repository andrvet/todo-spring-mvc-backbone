# Todo MVC
Spring MVC restful API. Tomcat. Backbone. Maven  

1.) Clone git repo to local machine.
2.) Run Maven to build and run the app
```bash
    $ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
or just run Application.main() as a java app

3.) go to: http://localhost:8080/ in a browser

## TODO

Once started the app creates an in-memory DB which will retain any entered data while the server is up.  

Bugs/enhancement. Need to:
1) create a todo item or edit an existing one.  
2) mark an item as complete or remove them all together from my list.  
3) any user's changes to be persistent between page refreshes and browser sessions (note that the server isn't restarted).
4) Front-end/css: below image  should be a guide to update the look of the app via CSS properties.
